Hill climbing Algorithm

This is one of AI algorithms. It is one of local searching fimaly. 
Basically, HCA is an optimized version of DFS (Depth First Search) 
where it uses a priority queue instead of a the traditional queue.
Hill Climing Algorithm have those main parts:

1- Begins the process from a root.

2- Use a priority queue.

3- Explore neighboring nodes and then choose the ine with highest value
  
4- stops when none of neighboring nodes with better value then the current node

The code on the page is working on python
